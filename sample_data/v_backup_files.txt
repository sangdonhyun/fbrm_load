Column	Data Type	Description
PKEY	NUMBER	The primary key for the backup.
BACKUP_TYPE	VARCHAR2(32)	The type of the backup: BACKUP SET, COPY, or PROXY COPY.
FILE_TYPE	VARCHAR2(32)	Type of the file backed up: DATAFILE, CONTROLFILE, SPFILE, REDO LOG, ARCHIVED LOG, COPY (for an image copy backup) or PIECE (for a backup piece).
KEEP	VARCHAR2(3)	Whether this backup has KEEP attributes set that override the backup retention policy. Values are YES or NO.
KEEP_UNTIL	DATE	Date after which this backup is considered obsolete.
KEEP_OPTIONS	VARCHAR2(13)	Attributes affecting retention for this backup. Possible values are NOLOGS, BACKUP_LOGS, LOGS, and NULL. NOLOGS indicates a consistent backup made when the database was mounted. BACKUP_LOGS indicates that the backup was made in open mode, so archived log backups must be applied to make it consistent. LOGS indicates a long-term backup made with the LOGS keyword, which is now deprecated. NULL indicates that this backup has no KEEP options and becomes obsolete based on the retention policy.
STATUS	VARCHAR2(16)	Status of the backup. Possible values are: AVAILABLE, UNAVAILABLE, EXPIRED.
FNAME	VARCHAR2(1024)	File name of this piece, copy, or file included in this backup set. For example, for a row whose BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET and FILE_TYPE is DATAFILE, FNAME is the name of the data file in the backup. On the other hand, if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET and FILE_TYPE is PIECE, then FNAME shows the name of backup piece.
TAG	VARCHAR2(32)	The tag for this backup piece or image copy. This column can only have a value if FILE_TYPE is PIECE or COPY.
MEDIA	VARCHAR2(80)	Media ID for the media on which the backup is stored. This column can only have a value if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET and FILE_TYPE is PIECE.
RECID	NUMBER	ID of the control file record corresponding to this row.
STAMP	NUMBER	Timestamp of the control file record corresponding to this row.
DEVICE_TYPE	VARCHAR2(255)	Device type on which this backup is stored. This column populated only if FILE_TYPE is PIECE or COPY.
BLOCK_SIZE	NUMBER	Block size for the backup or copy (in bytes).
COMPLETION_TIME	NUMBER	Time when this backup was completed. This column populated only if FILE_TYPE is PIECE or COPY.
COMPRESSED	VARCHAR2(3)	Whether the backup piece represented by this row is compressed. This column populated only if file-type is PIECE (since image copies cannot be compressed, by definition).
OBSOLETE	VARCHAR2(3)	Whether this backup piece or copy is obsolete. Possible value: YES, NO. This column populated only if FILE_TYPE is PIECE or COPY.
BYTES	NUMBER	Size of file described by this row. If BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET, this represents the total size of the backup set. If FILE_TYPE is PIECE or COPY, then this represents the size of the individual file. If FILE_TYPE is DATAFILE, ARCHIVED LOG, SPFILE or CONTROL FILE, the value represents how much data was incorporated into the backup set (but the corresponding backup set may be smaller, if compression was used in creating the backup set).
BS_KEY	NUMBER	Backup set key. This column populated only if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET. Use this column to join with RC_BACKUP_SET or RC_BACKUP_PIECE.
BS_COUNT	NUMBER	Backup set count. This column populated only if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET.
BS_STAMP	NUMBER	Backup set timestamp. This column populated only if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET.
BS_TYPE	VARCHAR2(32)	Type of backup set contents (data files or archived redo log files). This column populated only if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET.
BS_INCR_TYPE	VARCHAR(32)	Backup set incremental type (full or not). This column populated only if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET.
BS_PIECES	NUMBER	Number of pieces in backup set. This column populated only if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET.
BS_COPIES	NUMBER	Number of copies of this backup set. This column populated only if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET.
BS_COMPLETION_TIME	DATE	Completion time of the backup set. This column populated only if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET.
BS_STATUS	VARCHAR2(16)	Status of the backup set. Possible values are AVAILABLE, UNAVAILABLE, EXPIRED, or OTHER. (OTHER means that not all pieces of the backup set have the same status, which can happen if some are AVAILABLE and others UNAVAILABLE.) This column populated only if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET.
BS_BYTES	NUMBER	Sum of the sizes of all backup pieces in the backup set. This column populated only if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET.
BS_COMPRESSED	VARCHAR2(3)	Whether the backup pieces of this backup set are compressed. This column populated only if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET.
BS_TAG	VARCHAR2(1024)	Tag or tags of the backup pieces of this backup set. If pieces have different tags, then BS_TAGS contains a comma-delimited list of all tags for pieces in the backup set. This column is populated only if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET.
BS_DEVICE_TYPE	VARCHAR2(255)	Type of device on which this backup set is stored. If multiple copies of this backup set exist and are stored on different devices, then this field contains a comma-delimited list of all device types. For example, for a backup set that is on disk and also backed up on tape, BS_DEVICE_TYPE might contain DISK, SBT_TAPE. This column populated only if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET.
BP_PIECE#	NUMBER	Number of backup pieces that compose this backup set. This column populated only if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET.
BP_COPY#	NUMBER	Number of copies of this backup set. This column populated only if BACKUP_TYPE is BACKUP SET.
DF_FILE#	NUMBER	File number of the data file described by this row. This column populated only if FILE_TYPE is DATAFILE.
DF_TABLESPACE	VARCHAR2(30)	Tablespace name for the data file described by this row. This column populated only if FILE_TYPE is DATAFILE.
DF_RESETLOGS_CHANGE#	NUMBER	RESETLOGS change of the data file described by this row. This column populated only if FILE_TYPE is DATAFILE.
DF_CREATION_CHANGE#	NUMBER	Creation change number of the data file described by this row. This column populated only if FILE_TYPE is CONTROLFILE,DATAFILE or SPFILE.
DF_CHECKPOINT_CHANGE#	NUMBER	Checkpoint change number of the data file described by this row. This column populated only if FILE_TYPE is CONTROLFILE,DATAFILE or SPFILE.
DF_CKP_MOD_TIME	DATE	Checkpoint time of the data file described by this row. Valid only if FILE_TYPE is CONTROLFILE,DATAFILE or SPFILE.
RL_THREAD#	NUMBER	Redo log thread number of the archived redo log described by this row. Valid only if FILE_TYPE is ARCHIVED LOG.
RL_SEQUENCE#	NUMBER	Redo log sequence number of the archived redo log described by this row. Valid only if FILE_TYPE is ARCHIVED LOG.
RL_RESETLOGS_CHANGE#	NUMBER	RESETLOGS change number of the archived redo log described by this row. Valid only if FILE_TYPE is ARCHIVED LOG.
RL_FIRST_CHANGE#	NUMBER	First change number in the archived redo log described by this row. Valid only if FILE_TYPE is ARCHIVED LOG.
RL_FIRST_TIME	DATE	Time of the first change in the archived redo log described by this row. Valid only if FILE_TYPE is ARCHIVED LOG.
RL_NEXT_CHANGE#	NUMBER	Change number after the archived log described by this row. Valid only if FILE_TYPE is ARCHIVED LOG.
